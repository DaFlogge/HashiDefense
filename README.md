# HashiDefense
HashiDefense is planned to be a cross-platform 2D TowerDefense-Puzzler Hybrid. It is based on the Puzzle game Hashi where the player connects Nodes to form a network based on a certein rule set. In HashiDefense these Nodes are the Towers and connecting them means powering them up. Powered Towers can shoot targets. The goal of the game is to solve the underlying Hashi before the enemies reach the end of their path.
